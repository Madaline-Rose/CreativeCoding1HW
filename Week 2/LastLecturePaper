 While watching the Last Lecture video there were many things that stuck out to me, however, there was one in particular. 
Brick walls were mentioned many times and are symbols of running into a setback, challenge, or issue within your life. As Randy 
mentions these are important and are there to see how much you want something. It is an interesting perspective to me because I also
hear people talk about how when something does not work out the way you expected or you come across a road block then it means there
is something else meant for you (another path). I think both have valid points to them and would be good to consider them both  when reaching
for your dreams/goals. One message that I could identify with has to be about the importance of the people around you. Especially people 
who push you, critique you, or even keep you humble. These are not bad people, there is a difference between being degraded and bluntly supportive. As randy
had mentioned briefly two people could be saying the same thing but the way in which it is conveyed matters a lot. Now the sole reason I identify with this message
is because I have a prime example in my own life, my dad. Sometimes I was never happy with the conversations we had but I think he has helped significantly on my mindset
towards challenges. It was always something like, "well did you look at it this way?" or maybe "don't give up just yet, there is always a solution to a problem". 
These are just a few (more softly put) examples. Maybe this is why the brick wall metaphor stuck with me; it reminded me so much of the way my dad approaches life. 
Overall, even for a lecture a little over an hour Randy was amazing at making that fly by and I felt very inspired and motivated to fulfill my own dreams.
