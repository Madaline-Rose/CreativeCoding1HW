  At first yes I did think our learning styles affected how we learn. After reading the article "The Problem with “Learning Style””by Cindi May I am not so sure.
Now I think it is important on how we  engage with material and maybe even take it in multiple styles. I also think the reason why most people have ‘prefered’ learning styles is because 
they were never taught how to properly tackle other learning styles. However, I do think for certain subjects there could be an ‘easier’ method(s) to presenting and learning new information. 
Such as when kids are learning to match objects to words then a visual learning approach is better used. Or if a student goes into mechanics 101 it is better to use a hands on approach as I think it could help
with real life problem solving skills. Overall, I guess what I am trying to say is that I don’t think just one method is enough but there are more beneficial ways in which you can present and use those methods. 
I also think it is important in how we study/learn. Such as how often to revisit old material, effective note taking skills, and having a variety of ways to take in new information.
