The difference between CLI and GUI:

Graphical User Interface and Command-Line Interface are both ways in which you can interact with your computer. GUI (Graphic User Interface) is the visual element that we interact with when using technology. 
Such as touching, clicking, or using shortcuts to interact with buttons/icons. There are also a lot less ways to interact or manipulate this way. However, GUI is more user friendly (especially to those who do not understand the syntax).
A CLI (Command-Line Interface) is another way to interact with your technology, however, with more precision. CLI displays more information and allows for quicker manipulation of files and directories. 
CLI also provides faster development and as the name suggests it will be in the form of command lines -lines of texts and files. There is no graphics used in CLI unlike GUI where along with text, images and videos can be used to show/present information. 
Some other differences is that because CLI uses command prompts it runs faster and takes up less memory. While a GUI uses more things such as graphics that make it run slower and take up more memory. 
All in all, Graphical User Interface is more user-friendly and efficient at getting straight to the point. While Command-Line Interface allows for greater control and precision in the interaction and at a lower cost of time and space.
