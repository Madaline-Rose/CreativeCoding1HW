Proposal: 
    I love movies and knew I wanted my prokect based arround it. I wanted to challenge myself though. I have already done a movie trivia and short interactive stories (simplistic yes, but still). While searching around for inspiration I came across AR movie posters. ALthough not huge yet I could find some examples. Which lead me to my idea, a digital interactive movie poster! When you click on certain objects it might spin, or make a sound. 

Inspiration:
- I saw on Instagram these people specialize in AR/VR/IRl
    - https://www.instagram.com/thesunkenblimp/reel/DHqhBrPudQ5/?api=%E5%87%AF%E6%97%B6.%E5%B0%8A%E9%BE%99%E4%BA%BA%E7%94%9F%E5%B0%B1%E6%98%AF%E5%8D%9A%E3%80%90%E9%97%AE%EF%BC%9AWS99.ORG%E3%80%91.kfpq&hl=zh-cn 
    - This doesn't have any relation to the design I want to to do but I still wanted to include it because it was the start of the idea

- A website mentioning AR movie poster
    - https://www.nxtinteractive.sg/blog/ar-movie-posters-in-cinemas 
    - Same as the point above, not what I will be doing but the start of my inspo

- Interactive posters/books
    - I don't have specific sources besides what I see when i put the prompt in Pintrest

- Cube Escape video game
    - I want the concept to be similar to a point and click game using 2D elements
    - Cube escape is just one example

Challenges
- Making sure only the area/object that is clicked does an action
- Cursor tracker (like when hoovering over an object it enlarges a little to show it is interactable)
- I would also like to use sound but I will need to learn how
- Inserting oustide sources of images/stickers

Work Plan
- April 29th-30th
    - In p5.js create poster elements (background, colors, text)
    - add images or placholders (what I want to be interactive)
    - nothing is interactable just visual

- May 1st-2nd
    - Work on adding interactivity (sounds, hover, etc)

- May 3rd-4th
    - Polish visual design and add finishing effects
    - possibly continue to add interactive parts

- May 5th
    - Double check everything works
    - Make sure my read me is up to date

What I have done so far:
- I have done research into the type of project 
- Chose movie (Treasure Planet)
- Made concept poster in Canvas
- Took some notes of what I wanted to make interactable 
- I UPLOADED SEPERATE FILE FROM CANVAS REFERENCE I CREATED
